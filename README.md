# Kostarelas site

# Purpose
The Kostarelas family has multiple projects and sites that provide a better representation of what we work on.\
Publicly listing the source is a good way to receive feedback, and to hopefully give back to people looking to host a similar basic one page solution.

# Features
- The page has custom (but messy) css classes that operate for both light and dark mode devices.
- Cards can be added in the future to represent new projects.
